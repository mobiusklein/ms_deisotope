Data Serialization
------------------

:mod:`ms_deisotope` can write mass spectra to file in either :title-reference:`mzML`,
:title-reference:`MGF`, and :title-reference:`mzMLb` formats with builtin serializers for
raw and deisotoped mass spectra, preserving as much metadata as these formats allow.
