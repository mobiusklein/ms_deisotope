Welcome to ms_deisotope's documentation!
========================================

:mod:`ms_deisotope` contains a variety of implementations for deisotoping and charge
state deconvolution of mass spectra. It uses :mod:`ms_peak_picker` to perform the low
level signal processing needed to translate profile spectra into centroided *m/z* peak lists
and :mod:`brainpy` to generate theoretical isotopic patterns that it fits to these centroids
to produce deconvoluted *neutral mass* peak lists.

:mod:`ms_deisotope` also includes a data access layer for reading mass spectra from several
common formats, including instrument information and and file metadata.
