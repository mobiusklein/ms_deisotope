def xrea(peaks):
    """Calculate an approximation of the Xrea spectral quality metric.

    Xrea is essentially a measure of whether or not a spectrum is "flat", having no prominent
    peaks. Such spectra are more likely to be low quality.

    This implementation is based upon the implementation in SpectraST's denoising method [1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : :class:`Iterable` of :class:`PeakLike` or :class:`Iterable` of :class:`float`
        The peaks to calculate the quality measure of, or their intensities

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`float`
